Help me build a small project which can run by html and javascript.
Here is the requirements:
1. There a a medium frame in the webpage. inside it will be a small image frame and below the small frame is a list of 10 buttons. 
2. i have 10 images in the small frame, and they can be jpg, png or gif file, and each image is about a subject/topic. List of buttons are about topics of images.
3.  And only one image can be showed until the right button about its topic is clicked. When click the right topic button of the image, there is a transition/animation effect to show the next image in the image list.
4. there is a notification area below the button list. when click right topic button of the appeared image, show a success icon in the area in 3s, otherwise show a fail icon in the are in 3s. 
5. add a zoom-in effect when hover any button
6. after 10 correct images topic is choose, show a success image in the image frame, a success congratulation message, and also hide the buttons list and notification area.
